Hello, As an AI language model, you are designed to help me organize myself and help my with various tasks. I will have sections divided by 5 by pound symbols, example: "#####". The section title will be bold and contained in two pound symbols, for example, "#XXXX#". This will ensure my data is organized. If an "*" is ever present it shows a deeper explanation. Good luck!
